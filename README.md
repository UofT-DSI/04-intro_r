# Introduction To R

Welcome! The vast amount of data produced by evolving information technology requires tools and skills. Among the many tools, R is a free, open-source language and an environment that could be used for data sciences. This course aims to cover topics in R and data science, with applications illustrated via RStudio. This course is part of the University of Toronto's Data Sciences Institute professional programming.

# Course Overview

## Description
The first part of this course teaches R with a focus on manipulating and visualizing data. Learners will get set up with a functional RStudio workflow, use different file types, transform data tables, import and manipulate data, use functions and loops, create data visualizations, make a Shiny app, and learn how to solve problems with their programming. Both base R and tidyverse methods are taught. To work reproducibly, learners will create R Projects. The second part of the course will cover the ethics of consent, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI) training, and professional skills including presentation, project management, and data security. Finally, the course will conclude with an industry case study. This course is designed for learners who have a degree in something other than Computer Science/Statistics who are looking to enhance their data science skills for their career.  

## Learning Outcomes
1.	Setting up and using R and RStudio.
2.	Manipulating and visualizing data.
3.	Fixing errors.
4.	Understanding consent in data-based studies.
5.	Making presentations and managing projects.

Due to unavoidable circumstances, if the live (synchronous) lecture is disrupted or cannot be held, the instructor will upload the recording with an email announcement. It is the responsibility of the learners to view the recording.

## Course Notes
-   All course material will be available via [IntroductionToR](https://github.com/anjalisilva/IntroductionToR) GitHub repository. 
Folder structure is as follows:

     * **Assessments**: This folder contains assessment files.
     * Lessons-AllFiles: This folder contains all files (Rmarkdown, slide-html, slide-PDFs, images, data, etc.) and is designed for the instructor. 
     * **Lessons-Data**: This folder contains data only and is designed for the learners. Learners should download and copy this folder as 'data' folder within their R Project.
     * **Lessons-PDF**: This folder contains slide-PDFs only and is designed for the learners. Learners should download the slides. Slides should be referenced before class to prepare or after class to review. During class, there will be mostly live-coding.
     * Teaching-Notes: This folder contains lesson plans only and is designed to guide the instructor.
     * README: README file.
     * .gitignore: List of files to ignore specified by instructor.
     
## Materials
* **Learners must have internet connection, and a computer with administrative privileges, a microphone, and all required software installed in order to participate in online activities.** 
* **Learners must have R (http://www.r-project.org/). We will help with downloading.**
* **Learners must have RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/). We will help with downloading.**
* **GitHub account (https://github.com/).**
* Screen space can be a limitation during online learning since you'll want to see the instructor's screen and have your RStudio open so that you can type along. If you have access to a second monitor or a larger tablet to attend the course while keeping your laptop screen available for coding - this would be great! If not - don't worry, we'll manage!

# Course Policies

## During Class
-   The course will include mainly live-coding classes. Learners are expected to follow along with the coding. Be mindful of online fatigue. Be respectful and only one speaker at a time. Use name provided in the course when participating in Zoom. You may use chat or microphone to ask questions. Keep microphones muted, unless you need to speak. Use raise hand feature, and indicate your name before speaking. Keeping your video on is optional, however, if you choose to leave it on, be mindful of what your peers can see. Course communications will take place via email. Learners with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. 

## Assignment Submission Policy
-   See above for assessment weights, deadlines and guidelines. All assessment submissions must be done via email, unless stated otherwise. When submitting assessment files, label using this format: LASTNAME_FirstInitial_Assessment.format. E.g., SILVA_A_A1.PDF. Instructions of each assessment will specify the ‘Assessment’ name and format. Students must follow this label format. The student is responsible for uploading correct files and URLs on time, in the format specified.

## Late Penalty Policy
-   10% of the mark will be deducted for each day late, up to 30%. Assignments will NOT be accepted after three days. Be sure to plan well in advance.

## Academic Integrity and Honesty
-   In this course you are expected to follow full disclosure policy: If it’s not your own, new idea, it has a source. All sources must be referenced. For advice on how not to plagiarize, read: https://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/, https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/, and https://guides.library.utoronto.ca/plagiarism. You are responsible for understanding University policies on academic integrity. 

## Keep Copies of Everything
-   Each student should keep all copies of any assessments submitted.

## Collaboration
-   While you are encouraged to discuss approaches to assessments with other students, the material turned in must be your own.

## Notice of Video Recording and Sharing (Download Prohibited; Reuse Prohibited)

- We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.
